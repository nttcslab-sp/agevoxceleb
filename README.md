# AgeVoxCeleb

## AgeVoxCeleb DATABASE
The AgeVoxCeleb is the large-scale, balanced,
and multi-modal age corpus that contains both video and speech of the same speakers
from a wide age range. 

The AgeVoxCeleb contains nearly 168k videos of approximately 5000 speakers selected 
from [VoxCeleb2](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox2.html).
All the videos are labeled with the speakerâ€™s real age estimated 
using each celebrity's name and title of the original YouTube video.
 
To know the detail of how we built AgeVoxceleb, please refer to our paper 
presented in [ICASSP2021](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9414272/).

### USAGE
In this repository, only annotation labels are distributed.
To obtain the data including audio files, cropped video files, and other meta information,
please visit the original web-page of [VoxCeleb2](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox2.html) and download them.

### Data description

Each line in ``utt2spk.train`` and ``utt2spk.test`` corresponds to a pair of the segment-id and annotated age labels 
in training and test sets. 
Note that the segment-id is composed of speaker-ID, video-ID, and segment-ID defined in the original VoxCeleb. 

In addition, please note that how to divide the data into training and test sets is different from ones defined in the original VoxCeleb dataset.
